        ## Single-cell assisted deconvolutional network
        
        Scaden is a deep-learning based algorithm for cell type deconvolution of bulk RNA-seq samples. It was developed 
        at the DZNE Tübingen and the ZMNH in Hamburg. Please check out the [documentation](https://scaden.readthedocs.io) for further information.
        A pre-print describing the method is available at Biorxiv: [Deep-learning based cell composition analysis from tissue expression profiles](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/659227v1)
