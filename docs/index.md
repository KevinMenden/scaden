## Single-cell Assisted Deconvolutional Network

Scaden is a tool for bulk RNA-seq cell type deconvolutional that uses a deep neural network ensemble trained
on artificial bulk data simulated with scRNA-seq datasets. This method was developed in the [Genome Biology of Neurodegenerativ Diseases group](https://www.dzne.de/en/research/research-areas/fundamental-research/research-groups/heutink/research-areasfocus/)
at the [DZNE TÃ¼bingen](https://www.dzne.de/en/about-us/sites/tuebingen/) and the [Medical Systems Biology](https://www.uke.de/english/departments-institutes/institutes/medical-systems-biology/team/index.html) group at the [ZMNH](https://www.uke.de/english/departments-institutes/centers/center-for-molecular-neurobiology-hamburg-(zmnh)/index.html). The main author is [Kevin Menden](https://github.com/KevinMenden).

A paper describing Scaden has been published in Science Advances:
[Deep-learning based cell composition analysis from tissue expression profiles](https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/6/30/eaba2619)

For information about how to install Scaden, go to the [Installation](installation.md) section. Look in the [Usage](usage.md)
section for general help with Scaden usage. In the [Datasets](datasets.md) section you'll find a list of prepared training datasets.
You can also have a look in the [Blog](blog.md) section, where I summarize new features that are added to Scaden.
